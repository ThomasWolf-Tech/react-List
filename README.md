# react-List
This was my first attempt at using react, redux, thunks, styled components, and selectors. 
This project ws built following along with Shaun Wassell on Linkedin Learning. 

In this project I have some excess code and notes. This was due to iterations of the project moving foward. 
To do this again I would branch each iteration.
